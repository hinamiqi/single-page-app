        <h2>It is a planet!</h2>

        <p>So why Pluto is the best? Let's find out.</p>

        <h2>Planet?</h2>
        <p>
          "I've heard that it is not a planet..." -- well, thats a lie! It is, and not any planet, but coolest of them (kek).
        </p>

        <p>
          "Not a planet thing" goes from big astronomers meeting happened in 2006, where those guys discussed newly discovered celestial bodies. Turned out, there are lots of faraway bodies similar to Pluto (even bigger, actually).
        </p>

        <p>
          So either we'll have dozens of planets in solar system, of we should create a new name for those objects. Astronomers decided to call them "Dawrf planets", and reasoned that Pluto should be called as such too.
        </p>

        <p>
          So it is a planet, just a dwarf one. But in reality that changes nothing. Pluto has a God name, and coolest of all. It lives a live of anime lone samurai, looks better then everyone else, and doesn't care.

        <h2>Pluto is beutiful</h2>

        <p>
          Look at theese bright colors, perfectly matching, like ones on old masters oil painings.
        </p>


        <p>
          I painted them myself on top of the Nasa photo, but they're exactly match reality, if you happen to be near Pluto conveniently litted by point light source.
        </p>

        <h2>And handsome</h2>

        <p>
          And all theese beutiues are as brutal as their names: Cthulhu Macula, Morgoth Macula, Barlog Macula, Pandemonium Dorsa...
        </p>

        <p>
          That awesome giant red spot is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/space/pluto/@-9.9688506,-101.3815592,24390901m/data=!3m1!1e3">Cthulhu Macula</a>, btw. It is billions of years old, darkest and coldest place on a planet with temparature around 37K, so it is as metal, as it gets.

        <h2>Pluto is lonely</h2>

        <p>
          Pluto is pretty small and very far away from us. By "far away" I mean biilions of killometers away. It is not easy to grasp how far it is. Billion is big number. If you can consistenly run at 10 km/h (which is not easy, tell you like a former fatass) you'll get there in something like 80 thousand years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Pluto has friends: Charon, Hydra and others greek monstrosities.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see, Pluto needs you love.
